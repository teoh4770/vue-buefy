# vue+buefy

Layout & elements
Buefy has the entire Bulma's core built in. You can use any feature from Bulma, plus all the components Buefy offers

What This Means
Buefy is built on top of Bulma, so you get two things in one:
1. Bulma (CSS Framework)

- Layout system (columns, containers, sections)
- CSS utility classes
- Basic HTML elements styling

2. Buefy (Vue Components)

- Interactive JavaScript components
- Vue-powered functionality
